      "description": "This action allows a decker or technomancer to slightly alter the operation of multiple physical devices so they respond to the hacker’s commands. If the hacker has at least 1 mark on the host, a successful Test allows them to control one similar simple device at gamemaster discretion slaved to that host for every net hit. This action cannot be used to make an attack. The hacker can sustain controlling these devices as a Complex Action each Combat Turn. See book for more info.",

      "description": "The hacker may “tag” a number of targets on a single PAN, equal to their net hits, within their line of sight. They can then relay those tags wirelessly to allies. Tagging a target negates up to 2 dice in pen-alties from Visibility and Light/Glare to any affected ranged attack rolls allies may be making against that target, including blind-fire due to invisibility or shoot-ing through cover. Allies who can see a tag may also take one additional Take Aim Action against that tar-get as a Free Action on each Initiative Pass.Tags may be sustained by spending a Sim-ple Action to refresh the tags each Combat Turn. When using a PI-Tac, the hacker may add the PI-Tac’s level to the number of targets they may tag. Note: In order for allies to receive this bonus, they must have the ability to see AROs.",
